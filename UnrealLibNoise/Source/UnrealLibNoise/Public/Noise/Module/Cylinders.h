/// This noise module outputs concentric cylinders centered on the origin.
/// These cylinders are oriented along the @a y axis similar to the
/// concentric rings of a tree.  Each cylinder extends infinitely along
/// the @a y axis.
///
/// The first cylinder has a radius of 1.0.  Each subsequent cylinder has
/// a radius that is 1.0 unit larger than the previous cylinder.
///
/// The output value from this noise module is determined by the distance
/// between the input value and the the nearest cylinder surface.  The
/// input values that are located on a cylinder surface are given the
/// output value 1.0 and the input values that are equidistant from two
/// cylinder surfaces are given the output value -1.0.
///
/// An application can change the frequency of the concentric cylinders.
/// Increasing the frequency reduces the distances between cylinders.  To
/// specify the frequency, call the SetFrequency() method.
///
/// This noise module, modified with some low-frequency, low-power
/// turbulence, is useful for generating wood-like textures.
///
/// This noise module does not require any source modules.
