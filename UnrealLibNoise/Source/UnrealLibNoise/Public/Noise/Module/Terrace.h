/// Noise module that maps the output value from a source module onto a
/// terrace-forming curve.
///
///
/// This noise module maps the output value from the source module onto a
/// terrace-forming curve.  The start of this curve has a slope of zero;
/// its slope then smoothly increases.  This curve also contains
/// <i>control points</i> which resets the slope to zero at that point,
/// producing a "terracing" effect.  Refer to the following illustration:
///
///
/// To add a control point to this noise module, call the
/// AddControlPoint() method.
///
/// An application must add a minimum of two control points to the curve.
/// If this is not done, the GetValue() method fails.  The control points
/// can have any value, although no two control points can have the same
/// value.  There is no limit to the number of control points that can be
/// added to the curve.
///
/// This noise module clamps the output value from the source module if
/// that value is less than the value of the lowest control point or
/// greater than the value of the highest control point.
///
/// This noise module is often used to generate terrain features such as
/// your stereotypical desert canyon.
///
/// This noise module requires one source module.
