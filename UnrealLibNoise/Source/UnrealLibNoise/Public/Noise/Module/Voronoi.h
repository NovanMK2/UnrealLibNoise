/// In mathematics, a <i>Voronoi cell</i> is a region containing all the
/// points that are closer to a specific <i>seed point</i> than to any
/// other seed point.  These cells mesh with one another, producing
/// polygon-like formations.
///
/// By default, this noise module randomly places a seed point within
/// each unit cube.  By modifying the <i>frequency</i> of the seed points,
/// an application can change the distance between seed points.  The
/// higher the frequency, the closer together this noise module places
/// the seed points, which reduces the size of the cells.  To specify the
/// frequency of the cells, call the SetFrequency() method.
///
/// This noise module assigns each Voronoi cell with a random constant
/// value from a coherent-noise function.  The <i>displacement value</i>
/// controls the range of random values to assign to each cell.  The
/// range of random values is +/- the displacement value.  Call the
/// SetDisplacement() method to specify the displacement value.
///
/// To modify the random positions of the seed points, call the SetSeed()
/// method.
///
/// This noise module can optionally add the distance from the nearest
/// seed to the output value.  To enable this feature, call the
/// EnableDistance() method.  This causes the points in the Voronoi cells
/// to increase in value the further away that point is from the nearest
/// seed point.
///
/// Voronoi cells are often used to generate cracked-mud terrain
/// formations or crystal-like textures
///
/// This noise module requires no source modules.
