/// like the concentric rings of an onion.

/// The first sphere has a radius of 1.0.  Each subsequent sphere has a
/// radius that is 1.0 unit larger than the previous sphere.
///
/// The output value from this noise module is determined by the distance
/// between the input value and the the nearest spherical surface.  The
/// input values that are located on a spherical surface are given the
/// output value 1.0 and the input values that are equidistant from two
/// spherical surfaces are given the output value -1.0.
///
/// An application can change the frequency of the concentric spheres.
/// Increasing the frequency reduces the distances between spheres.  To
/// specify the frequency, call the SetFrequency() method.
///
/// This noise module, modified with some low-frequency, low-power
/// turbulence, is useful for generating agate-like textures.
///
/// This noise module does not require any source modules.
