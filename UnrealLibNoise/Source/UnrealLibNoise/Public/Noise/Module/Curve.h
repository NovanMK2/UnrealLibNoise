/// This noise module maps the output value from the source module onto an
/// application-defined curve.  This curve is defined by a number of
/// <i>control points</i>; each control point has an <i>input value</i>
/// that maps to an <i>output value</i>.  Refer to the following
/// illustration:
///
///
/// To add the control points to this curve, call the AddControlPoint()
/// method.
///
/// Since this curve is a cubic spline, an application must add a minimum
/// of four control points to the curve.  If this is not done, the
/// GetValue() method fails.  Each control point can have any input and
/// output value, although no two control points can have the same input
/// value.  There is no limit to the number of control points that can be
/// added to the curve.  
///
/// This noise module requires one source module.
